        <p>This is my newest album album. I made the project in a weird time in my life. It was hot off of the last album, and i just wanted to do the complete opposite of what I was doing on the previous stuff. Its grungey, its gross, its introspective. It follows the story of me grappling with myself, and whether I want to continue doing this whole music thing....</p>
